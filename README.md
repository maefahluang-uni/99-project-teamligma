# VR Game For Education
In this project, we will make VR about education or use in science experiments by turning experiments into VR games to make them easy to use,   
without having to spend money or resources in one experiment in real life. But we put it in VR so that we didn't have to spend money or waste resources on experiments,   
so this project was born.
